## Reflections on Martin Fowlers XP views

**YAGNI: You aren't doing to need it**

This is an interesting concept. It stands for: even if you know you need it next sprint, don't build it now. 

This makes me wonder about DLS updates. So the planned DLS update isn't in this sprint. So you should just hack the existing component? But this leads to more effort in the future, and not necessarily less effort now.

**CI, Testing, Refactoring: the keys to making XP work**

I can see that CI and testing are easy buy ins for companies.
However I feel refactoring is often one that is not in the hands of the developers. So refactoring may be the desire of the engineering team, but they may not be allowed to do it by the rest of the company.

Interesting because it will be the engineering team that decides to do XP. So they do it, but without the full control needed to do it well.

I wonder how many teams are aware of the need to get buy in from other stakeholders, in order to do XP properly. And how many fail to recognise this need, and then blame XP.
