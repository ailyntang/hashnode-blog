## Label in stackview is cut off or not expanding

Simple answer: update alignment to "center"
If alignment is "fill", then the stackview will only be as tall as the icon height, and it looks like the label is cut off vertically and it won't expand to its full size.

You do not need to play around with hugging priority nor compression resistance for this example.
