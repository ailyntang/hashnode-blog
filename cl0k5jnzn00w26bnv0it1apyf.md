## Unable to install app on mobile device


Error: This app cannot be installed because its integrity could not be verified


* The issue is due to device not added to profile. 
* Check the profile on Bitrise, look for the device ID by device ID 
  * the device which is having this error will be missing

The fix: remove that profile, add a new profile with the device ID
