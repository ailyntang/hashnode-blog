What is covered

* There are 8 videos. Goal is to recreate SwiftUI using `import Foundation` only. That way we can see what `import SwiftUI` is doing under the hood to update only the views that are dirty, and no other view
    
* This episode lays the groundwork for various protocols. It doesn't actually build any views (I don't know if it will)
    
* The goal is to have a button title update from 0, 1, 2, etc each time the button is tapped
    

What I learnt

* This kind of video is not my jam. I have to really pay attention, otherwise I drift
    
* I prefer videos which are less abstract, and more about using `SwiftUI` to demonstrate what `SwiftUI` does. Rather than videos which build something else.
