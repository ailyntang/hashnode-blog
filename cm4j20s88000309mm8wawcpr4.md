# Normalized databases:

**Definition**

* The “purest” form of a database, where all databases are scoped to be as small as possible
    
* The database can contain FK indexes to allow for joining to other DBs
    
* e.g. Reports Table, which has columns for: report id (PK), student id (FK), subject id (FK) and grade for that report
    
* e.g. Student table, which has columns for student id (PK), student first name, last name, DOB, etc.
    

**Pros**:

* If you don’t need something outside the scope, then things are lightning fast
    
* Also there is only one source of truth
    

**Cons:**

* If you need something outside of the scope, you’ll be doing lots of joins
    
* This can get confusing if you don’t know where to join to
    

# Denormalized databases

**Definition**

* The database has information that is commonly used together for the end user (e.g. someone in the BI team)
    
* e.g. whenever the end user wants a printout of the reports, they almost always want to know the students name and the name of the subject that related to that report
    
* So we would end up importing a copy of those columns to the reports table:
    
    * e.g. report id(PK), student id (FK), subject id (FK), grade for that report
        
    * PLUS replicated data from other tables: student name, subject name, teacher name, etc.
        

**Pros**

* Makes it much easier to work with for the end user - no requirements to join
    
* Less likely to get incorrect information, when you join on a table that you think is the right one, but it actually isn’t, but there’s no way to know. Or join incorrectly.
    

**Cons**

* Multiple sources of truth
    
* You have to be aware that the copied data needs time to be copied over, and implement a process for doing that at a cadence that is appropriate (as these processes are expensive I imagine)
