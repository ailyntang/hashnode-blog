Thoughts on what to discuss at each stage

# Step 1: narrow the scope

* **Scale**: how many users / traffic
    
* **Security / Authentication:** is this already in place?
    
* **Data size**: e.g. handling videos is different to images vs small data like credit card transactions
    

# Step 2: Design

* Sketch out the infrastructure layer to buy you time to think

* Then the bit underneath is probably the “real” systems design for a backend dev
    
* Typically it’s some service that talks to some DB and/or Cache
    
* Considerations:
    
    * Webjobs
        
        * Scheduled / triggered
            
        * Rate limiting
            
    * Database
        
        * Relational (SQL) / non-relational (Cosmos)
            
        * Normalised / denormalised
            
        * Locking vs not
